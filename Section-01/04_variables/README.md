To understand how to write and use variables, take a look at the example code in the [gsg_package_level_variables](https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_package_level_variables)

There's 2 ways to run the code in this repo:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_package_level_variables.git
cd gsg_package_level_variables
go run .
```

Or:

```bash
$ go get github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_package_level_variables
$ go run github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_package_level_variables
```

If you're running the `go get ...` command for the first time on you're workstation, then it ends up creating the following folder:

```
$ cd ~/go
$ tree .
.
└── bin
    └── gsg_package_level_variables
```
