Collections is used to refer to datatypes that data together, e.g. arrays and dictionaries. 

- Arrays - a fixed sized list of entities
- Slices - like arrays, but with a dynamic list size. Hence slices are more commonly used compared to arrays. 
- maps - key-value list, i.e. hash tables. 
- structs - similar to maps, but used to define a particular type of object, e.g. employee. Probably to what we have in object oriented programming. 

To understand how to write and use variables, take a look at the example code in the [gsg_arrays](https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_arrays)

There's 2 ways to run the code in this repo:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_arrays.git
cd gsg_arrays
go run .
```

Or:

```bash
go get github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_arrays
go run github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_arrays
```
