Collections is used to refer to datatypes that data together, e.g. arrays and dictionaries. 

- Arrays - a fixed sized list of entities
- Slices - like arrays, but with a dynamic list size. Hence slices are more commonly used compared to arrays. 
- maps - key-value list, i.e. hash tables. 
- structs - similar to maps, but used to define a particular type of object, e.g. employee. Probably to what we have in object oriented programming.
