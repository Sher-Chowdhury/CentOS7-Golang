To understand how to write and use variables, take a look at the example code in the [gsg_methods](https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_methods)

There's 2 ways to run the code in this repo:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_methods.git
cd gsg_methods
go run .
```

Or:

```bash
go get github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_methods
go run github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_methods
```

the struct and methods goes hand in hand in golang.
